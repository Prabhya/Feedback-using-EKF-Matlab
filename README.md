# Feedback-using-EKF-Matlab
Creating feedback using EKF

The aim is to create a program which discusses one of the uses of Ekf - using ekf to create state-feedback.
In most cases the observable state cannot be used to stabilize the system using output feedback. However, using ekf grants us the knowledge of full state and reduces alot of measurement noise in the process. this allows for the uses of these states to create the feedback needed to stabilize the system.
